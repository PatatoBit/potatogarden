## What happened
Sofia was a Russian girl participating in the [[2023 UK Summer Camp]]. A rather close friend with [[Moey]] at that time. I don't personally know much about this person apart from she being Russian and being in a relationship with [[Oahm]]. Funny thing is, [[Oahm]] has the same birthday as hers.

During the [[2023 UK Summer Camp]]. [[Oahm]] bought sofia a pandora. A rather expensive jewelry. I don't remember much else about what happened but [[Oahm]] did mention her a lot during the camp.

In the ending of the [[2023 UK Summer Camp]], [[Oahm]] invited her to the dance with the help of [[Moey]]]. [[Moey]] was a key communicator between those two and the reason why the dance even happened. To my surprise, she said yes and their dance was once of the most memorable event of the camp.

Later, I found out that she accepted [[Oahm]]'s confession. They bid their farewell and continues to chat together despite the difficulty of the Russian's sanctions because of the Russian-Ukranian war.
## Current status
I don't know much about their status currently. But, as of this record, [[Oahm]]'s date of their first meeting is still up ![[Pasted image 20240218194222.png]]

I also saw the her chat with [[Oahm]] on his iPad last Friday (16/2/2024). They seemed to be doing well as always. Good for them üòç.
