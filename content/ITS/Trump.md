## Introduction

Trump is a controversial person but not really. He used to be more favorable but after many rumors and incidents. Not anymore. Famous for his looks, piano skills, and academic performance. Coincidentally gaining reputation as teacher’s favorite. Though some do not as from his past incidents.  
  
I’ve not heard much of this Trump person before [[Moey]] moved in. I used to think that he was a really good person with a good head. 

## Relationship with [[Moey]]

After the the 2022 or 2021 summer. I've found out that [[Moey]] and him started dating. This surprises me back then as I did warn her about his possible rumors.

He got quite closer and more intimate over the months that they've been dating. From going to art class together to [[KPN]] music school. But things do take the turn for the worst.

According to second hand data from [[Moey]]. He allegedly crossed the line sexually and verbally. From abusive behaviors and talking in a way that **ahem** *y'know that way*. Although I do think both him and [[Moey]] are both wrong as they were both in on it and she was just the first to back out.

They shortly broke up after several fights on Line and Instagram DMs. Of course, I was part of the reason by informing her, essentially adding oil to the fire.

## The in-between

After the break up there were still some chats with Moey mainly abusing her and attempts to reunite. Though it didn't work quite well.

This was also the period of time of the [[2023 Summer Camp]] at the UK. [[Moey]] allegedly made an appointment with him to clear up the relationship. But he allegedly thought that it was her attempt of a reunion

## Relationship with  [[Nae Nae]]

The [[2023 Summer Camp]] was also what I call a love camp. This was when many people fell in love and date. Trump was one of them. There had been reports of Trump and [[Nae Nae ]] together from multiple sources.

If I remember correctly, he also bought [[Nae Nae]] a Pandora. Though, I'm not sure with this.

[[Moey]] had expressed concerned over their potential relationship along with many others. But it seemed like [[Nae Nae]] is [blinded by the lights](https://youtu.be/4NRXx6U8ABQ?si=OKP1WbtBtibjywZW)and still continues.

Trump never officially dated [[Nae Nae]] but remains a status of [siblings relationship](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Your+like+a+brother+to+me.) but I like to call it [open relationship](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=open+relationship). Reason why is, she also is kinda like him in a way.
